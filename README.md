## Group Members:
Brian Le, Logan Hernandez, Ricky Ho

## Our Project:
Our project is a simple basketball shooting game in which a player has 60 seconds to score as many points as possible. 

## How to run:
1. Clone or download our project into your local machine.
2. If you are running on Windows, run the file called "host.bat". If you are running on Mac, run the file called "host.command". This should
   prompt your command prompt to run a python command to create a server at port #### (this is usually port 8000).
3. Open up your chrome browser and enter in the url: localhost:#### (e.g. localhost:8000)
4. You should now be able to see the game and play!
